This architecture follows the vanilla U-NET like encoder-decoder pathway with additional intra-block feature fusion method for lightweight operation and faster inference. IFF-NET achieves equal results compared to both heavy models like vanilla unet, FUSegnet and lightweight models like mobilevnet, mobileunet etc.
